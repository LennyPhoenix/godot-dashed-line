# Godot Dashed Line Node

A simple dashed line for Godot Engine v3.

An example `DashedLine` node to allow godot's built in `_draw()` function to draw a dashed line with the line primitives in the engine. It mirrors the `draw_line` available already and allows you to specify the same parameters. 2 additional parameters are added to allow the specification of a `dash_length` and a `cap_end`.

`dash_length` allows you to say that you want a 100px line with a dash that is 4 pixels long.
`cap_end` allows you to say that you always want draw any remaining end dash to "cap" the line.
